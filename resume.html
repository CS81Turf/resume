            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                I bring a unique blend of real-world grit and tech savvy. By day, I manage lawns — by night, I write
                clean code and build web apps that solve real problems. Focused, curious, and never afraid to get my
                hands dirty.

                <p>
                    I apply the right amount of chemicals and fertilizer to lawns to keep them healthy and green. I also
                    manage the IT side of the business, ensuring our systems run smoothly and efficiently.
                    I have developed a web application that allows employees to correctly and efficiently apply the
                    right amount of chemicals and fertilizer to lawns.

                        CheMixer is a mobile-friendly web application I built to streamline chemical mixing calculations
                        for lawn care professionals. The app features preset formulas, custom input for square footage,
                        and real-time output of chemical quantities required — all displayed in a clean, colorful
                        interface. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive design that works. I designed and developed the entire application from the ground up, focusing on user
                        experience, responsive layout, and practical utility in the field.
