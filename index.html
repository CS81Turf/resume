            <h2>My story</h2>
            <p>
                I graduated from the University of Kentucky in 2003 with a B.S. in Plant and Soil Science. I spent over a
                decade working in golf course management, where I honed my skills in team leadership, problem-solving, and
                project management. In 2016, I transitioned to the lawn care industry, taking on the role of General Manager
                at Go Green Lawn Solutions. Here, I combined my passion for technology with my expertise in lawn care to
                develop innovative solutions that improve efficiency and service quality. I am looking to transition into a full-time web devloper role, where I can leverage my unique background and skills to create impactful web applications.

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <div class="item">
                <p>I started out of college working at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, KY in 2004. I learned the ins and outs of being a professional groundskeeper for a top-notch golf facility. We hosted numerous major championships, including: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>2004 and 2011 Senior PGA </li>
                        <li>2008 Ryder Cup</li>
                        <li>2014 PGA Championship</li>
                    </ul>
        
                I ran the crew of 20-30 people, assigning daily tasks, managing the irrigatioin system, making sure our chemicals were being applied when needed, and maintaining superb playing conditions.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After leaving Valhalla, I joined my former colleagues at Go Green Lawn Solutions as a lawn care technician. I am still there today and have helped grow the company by providing outstaning service and quality to people's lawns for over 10 years now. I felt like I wanted to do more with my life and wanted to find a possible career change where I could make more money to help pay for my kids education,especially as high-school and college approach. I somehow came across freeCodeCamp.org and starting teaching myself while I waited for over a year to get into the Code:You program. I'm very excited about what I'm learning and can't wait to put it to more use one day! I was into art as a younger kid and I compare designing websites to a modern art and find it faschinating!</p>

                    <p>
                        CheMixer is a mobile-friendly web application I built to streamline chemical mixing calculations
                        for lawn care professionals. The app features preset formulas, custom input for square footage,
                        and real-time output of chemical quantities required â€” all displayed in a clean, colorful
                        interface. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive design that works. I designed and developed the entire application from the ground up, focusing on user
                        experience, responsive layout, and practical utility in the field.
